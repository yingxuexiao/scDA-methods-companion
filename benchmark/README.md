# Single-Cell Differential Abundance (DA) Analysis Benchmark

## 📊 **Overview**

This repository contains the comprehensive benchmark implementation for evaluating **16 differential abundance (DA)** analysis methods on single-cell RNA sequencing data, as described in our publication. The benchmark includes evaluation code, workflows, simulated datasets, real datasets, and metrics computation for thorough method assessment.

---

## 🎯 **Evaluated Methods**

We systematically evaluated **16 state-of-the-art DA methods** for single-cell data analysis. The complete list of methods and their implementations are detailed in our publication.

---

## 🔍 **Method Selection Criteria**

Methods were selected based on the following rigorous criteria:

### ✅ **Criteria**

- **Method must be currently functional and maintained**
- **Specifically designed for single-cell data analysis**
- **Primary intent must be differential abundance analysis**

### 🚫 **Exclusion Criteria**

Several methods were excluded from our benchmark:

- **scellpam**: Primarily a clustering method, not designed for DA analysis
- **TascCODA**: Requires construction of cell-type hierarchy trees, dependent on well-defined cell-type relationships
- **Other exclusions**: Methods that were deprecated, not maintained, or primarily designed for other analytical purposes

## ⚠️ **Important Notes & Limitations**

This benchmark provides an initial comprehensive evaluation of DA methods, but several limitations should be considered:

### 🔬 **Current Limitations**

1. **Evaluation Depth**: The current analysis provides a broad overview rather than deep, method-specific optimization
2. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Limited exploration of parameter spaces for each method
3. **Dataset Scope**: Evaluation on a curated but not exhaustive set of biological scenarios
4. **Computational Resources**: Performance metrics may vary with different computational environments

---

## 🎯 **Purpose of This Benchmark**

This benchmark aims to:

- Help researchers **select appropriate DA methods** for their specific biological questions
- Provide **transparent** and **reproducible** evaluation workflows
- Highlight method **strengths** and **weaknesses** across different scenarios
- Serve as a foundation for future, more **specialized benchmarks**
