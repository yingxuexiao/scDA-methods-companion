Benchmarking for Differential Abundance Analysis (DA) Methods

This directory contains benchmark data and scripts for evaluating the performance of various differential abundance  analysis methods for single-cell RNA-seq data. The goal is to assess the effectiveness and reliability of different DA methods across multiple simulated and real-world datasets.

🎯 Overview

In this folder, we provide:

Simulated Data: Datasets generated with specific characteristics to test the sensitivity, specificity, and robustness of DA methods under different conditions.

Real Data: Pre-processed single-cell RNA-seq datasets that are used to evaluate DA methods in a more realistic setting.

Preprocessing Scripts: Scripts to process raw data, normalize, and filter the data before running DA analysis.

The aim is to provide a comprehensive benchmark that can be used for method comparison and to help users select the most appropriate DA method based on their data and analysis goals.
