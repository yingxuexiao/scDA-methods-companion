# CITRUS: Cluster Identification, Characterization, and Regression

## 📋 Overview
CITRUS identifies statistically significant cell subpopulations that correlate with experimental outcomes using regularized regression on high-dimensional cytometry data.

## 🎯 Core Principle
- Hierarchical clustering of cell populations
- Regularized regression to select predictive clusters
- False discovery rate control
- Model building and validation

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Language**: R
- **Core Model**: Regularized Regression (LASSO/Elastic Net)
- **Multi-group**: ✅ Supports multiple conditions


## 💡 Biological Applications
- Biomarker discovery in cytometry data
- Predictive modeling of clinical outcomes
- High-dimensional feature selection
